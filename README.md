# Cortex-Command-Workshop-Backup

This repository holds all of Cortex Command's Steam Workshop mods.

This backup was created because it has become impossible to download these mods through Steam, which is most likely the result of a Steam API update which the game won't ever be updated for.

These backed up mods are currently being updated to the [Cortex Command Community Project](https://cortex-command-community.github.io/) version of the game, and once that is done this repository will be deleted.
